  <h2>New Manuals Publisher features</h2>

  <p>Last updated 13 Jul 2023</p>

  <p>We are delivering some essential core features for Manuals Publisher over the next couple of months.
    We’ll share further details about each of the changes soon.</p>

  <p>We’re doing this because we did user research earlier this year and discovered that Manuals users are lacking some
    of the features that other publishing apps like Whitehall already have.</p>

  <p>If you have any questions or feedback about publishing, you can reach us on
    <a href="mailto:publishing-service-feedback@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk">publishing-service-feedback@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk</a>.
    For any other type of support, you can <a href="https://support.publishing.service.gov.uk/">submit a request via
    Zendesk</a>.</p>

  <h2>Recent changes</h2>

  <h3>Added Paste to Govspeak</h3>

  <p>13 Jul 2023</p>

  <p>You can now paste formatted text into the body field and Manuals publisher will try to convert it into GOV.UK’s
    version of <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-publish-on-gov-uk/markdown">Markdown</a>, Govspeak. We hope
    this feature will save you time when editing content.</p>

  <p>This works best when copying and pasting from text editing software like Word or Google Docs. It is less likely to
    recognise formatting from PDFs.</p>

  <p>It will convert:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>headings</li>
    <li>bullets</li>
    <li>numbered lists</li>
    <li>links</li>
    <li>email links</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Other formatting, such as tables, will be removed and only plain text pasted. You’ll need to write the Markdown for
    these separately.</p>
